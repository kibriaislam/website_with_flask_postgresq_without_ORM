## This project is build with Python ,flask framework and postgresql database

I start this project as a test for my sql knowledge. I have work with ORM on so many projects but i never got any chance to use raw sql query and show it to the website. 
So here i try to make a blog website where i can get data from my postgresql database without using any orm instead i use raw sql and retrive my data from postgresql database 
using psycopg2 package.

4. From the src folder just run pipenv install and it will install all the required packages from the Pipfile.
